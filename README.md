# Engineer-s-Blueprint

This code/app is designed to hold all the file data from Space Engineers and list it in a readable and understandable format so users don't have to scrape data for the information. 
This will once complete be re-uploaded as a standalone app which will get updates (user will have to download each version separately) that the user can actually use on their system (Future plans for a mobile version too).
This will eventually hopefully contain all of if not more than all of the data shown on https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki
